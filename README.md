#CPSC 304
CPSC 304 Project Winter 2015 T2

Install: MYSQL JDBC NetBeans

To-do List:

1. SQL file of the database (please doublecheck them and update if necessary) Note : I've tested the .sql file and made sure no compile error

2. Clone project, set up mySQL, import it to NetBeans

3. Add the necessary database information in DatabaseConnection.java, then test run it. Very basic Log-in and sign-up should be implemented already.
