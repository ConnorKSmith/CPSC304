# CPSC304
CPSC 304 Project Winter 2015 T2



Install: MYSQL JDBC NetBeans

To-do List:

1. SQL file of the database

2. https://netbeans.org/competition/win-with-netbeans/mysql-client.html <--  go through this tutorial if you have time, I found it to be very helpful.

3. Clone project, set up mySQL, import it to NetBeans

4. Add the necessary database information in DatabaseConnection.java, then test run it. Very basic Log-in and sign-up should be implemented already.
